# Q5. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in
# regression analysis.

# Advantage of Mean Squared error (MSE) - 
# 1. Equation is differentiable
# 2. it has only one local or global minima.

# disadvantages of Mean Squared error (MSE) - 
# 1. Not robust to outlier.
# 2. It is not in the same unit as we are squaring it

# # Advantage of Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 
# 1. Robust to outliers
# 2. It will be in the same unit

## disadvantage of Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
# 1. Convergence usually take more time.

#  Advantage of Root Mean Squared error (RMSE) :
# 1. it will be in same unit 
# 2. it is differentiable

#disadvantage of Root Mean Squared error (RMSE) :
# 1. Not robust to outliers.
